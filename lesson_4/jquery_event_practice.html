      This is a bunch of text. It doesn't really mean much, but whatevs. There are many incoherent, rambling lines of text, but this one is mine. There are many like it...but this one is mine. Somewhere over the rainbow, Oscar the Grouch is in a trash can. Who dreams the dreamer, and when is yesteryear? Why isn't it, and who? Show your work. Tip your servers, stay in school, and don't take life too seriously...you'll never get out alive.
